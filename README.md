# tinyapp# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

TinyApp allows users to edit long URLs, and delete entries.

The web application also allows users to track how many unique visitors and total visitors have clicked their short URLs. It also displays the timestamp and visitor ID's for every link.
